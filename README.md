### Description
In this exercise I will create a class Animal, but I will not implement a pure virtual function. 
```
class Animal {
	public:
		virtual void makeSound( void ) const;
	[...]
}
```
This means that I allow an implementation of the function makeSound in the class Animal. 
There is a class WrongAnimal that shows the wrong implementation of the function makeSound.  

I made a test_cpp folder in which I test creating different objects of the class Animal and WrongAnimal and veryfing the order of the constructors and destructors.
